# RailsConditionalParams

This gem patches `ActionController::Parameters` to support conditional
parametersâ€”parameters that are permitted only if some condition is true.
Basically, it ensures that any hash key passed to `permit()` with `true` as
its value is made into a permitted key, while keys passed with `false` or `nil`
are ignored.

It is compatible with Rails 4.2 and later, including Rails 5.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_conditional_params'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_conditional_params

## Usage

    params.permit(:title, :body, published: admin?)
		# published will only be permitted if admin? returns true
